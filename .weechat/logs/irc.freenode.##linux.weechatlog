2018-11-27 19:14:42	dsol	Hello. I'm trying to run several nmap processes simultaneously. I have tried xargs and parallel, but I'm struggling. https://pastebin.com/ZT4aY761 In the first example I need to replace the subnet mask / with [] somehow. The other example wont work at all due to the number of arguments. Also note that I'm passing a lot more arguments to nmap than just the onces in the example. Can anyone help me out?

2018-11-27 20:59:58	ayecee	BobLazer: the fact that you can't mount the disk, though, suggests either your mount command is wrong or there's disk damage.
2018-11-27 21:00:15	BobLazer	it makes it to the windows login screen
2018-11-27 21:00:22	BobLazer	it's an old ass hard drive
2018-11-27 21:00:27	BCMM	ayecee: have you read the mount command he tried?
2018-11-27 21:00:29	ayecee	so, probably bad mount command
2018-11-27 21:00:34	BobLazer	it's like having a whale inside my computer (60GB)

2018-11-27 21:01:56	ayecee	BobLazer: your mount command from earlier would never work. we're wondering if that was the actual, literal command, or if you typo'ed it when putting it on irc.
2018-11-27 21:02:06	BCMM	BobLazer: do you have a `chntpw` command?
2018-11-27 21:02:32	BobLazer	sudo mount /dev/sda /media/drive1

2018-11-27 21:03:03	BCMM	BobLazer: /dev/sda is the whole hard disk. you want to mount a partition, not the whole disk

2018-11-27 21:04:10	BobLazer	BCMM im not sure what its setup with, one sec...
2018-11-27 21:04:11	BCMM	BobLazer: note that internal hard disks almost always have a partition table, even if they only contain a single partition

2018-11-27 21:05:17	BCMM	BobLazer: people often talk about "partitioning" a hard drive in the context of making space to install a 2nd OS or something, so it's worth pointing out that there's usually a partition table even if there's only one c:\ drive

2018-11-27 21:06:59	sklv	i would personally check if his previous mount is present in the mount table

2018-11-27 21:07:51	BobLazer	BCMM it's mounted!!!! i can see inside!

2018-11-27 21:09:05	bn_work	edd_lc:   thanks, I'll potentially take a look 👍  just out of curiosity, how does `mv`'s `--backup=numbered` feature work?  does it just automatically suffix a `.~`n; where n = auto-incrementing integer, whenever it copies a file into a dir that already has the same filename?

2018-11-27 21:10:04	ayecee	BobLazer: does ophcrack actually reset passwords? I'd think it would be for brute forcing the password.
2018-11-27 21:10:04	BCMM	BobLazer: so, ophcrack might take really quite a long time on old hardware, since it has to guess the existing password
2018-11-27 21:10:20	ayecee	pogostick, or this chntpw, would be faster.

2018-11-27 21:11:13	BCMM	BobLazer: something like chntpw would let you just set a new password instantly, but if you've already got ophcrack working, i guess there's no harm in giving it a try in case it gets it quickly

2018-11-27 22:22:29	pythys	So what, could it be that all 3 drivers are not working because of ... something
2018-11-27 22:22:32	ayecee	pythys: i mean, it's not a bug in the driver, but it may be a quirk in the hardware that can be worked around in the driver.
2018-11-27 22:22:43	pythys	I see I see
2018-11-27 22:22:54	ayecee	pythys: to investigate this, you'd have to examine where xrandr gets its information from, and figure out why that information is wrong.

Meaning that when menus, like file selection menu, open, its bigger than the screen. Also Skype, when it is the only window opened, has some issues. I think its due to me not setting the dpi.

2018-11-28 03:40:07	herbert_cyborg	Arch Linux has value to me because it is rolling release, provides reasonably up to date packages (with truly bleeding edge packages in the testing repo), has an extensive user repository, and a good build system
2018-11-28 03:40:20	Tech_8	really
2018-11-28 03:40:22	herbert_cyborg	Truly nothing comes close to the convenience of the AUR
2018-11-28 03:40:36	Psi-Jack	There's plenty of things that comes close to the convenience of AUR.
2018-11-28 03:40:37	Tech_8	I never tried arch linux
2018-11-28 03:41:00	Tech_8	only debian, fedora, redhat, freebsd

2018-11-28 03:42:03	Psi-Jack	herbert_cyborg: You do understand than AUR only exists because Arch Linux maintainers don't want to maintain EVERYTHING, right?
2018-11-28 03:42:08	herbert_cyborg	Ubuntu + PPAs is a PIA compared to Arch Linux + AUR

2018-11-28 03:42:57	mawk	yeah herbert_cyborg especially when you don't have a Ph.D in bash you don't always have the skill to recognize bad code

2018-11-28 03:42:59	herbert_cyborg	Psi-Jack If you need to install things from the AUR every day then I question whether you have an cohesive workflow
2018-11-28 03:43:12	herbert_cyborg	BCMM: that's literally the first thing I check
2018-11-28 03:43:18	BCMM	herbert_cyborg: does aur not have automatic updates?
2018-11-28 03:43:24	Psi-Jack	herbert_cyborg: Well, things update frequently. Soemtimes every day, sometimes multiple times a day. :)
2018-11-28 03:43:49	herbert_cyborg	BCMM: AUR isn't an application. It's just a repository. You can have a script which automatically updates applications installed from the AUR if you want, but it's not recommended.

2018-11-28 03:44:21	Psi-Jack	BCMM: Well, Technically AUR is unsupported, period.
2018-11-28 03:44:22	mawk	that's not very security-friendly
2018-11-28 03:44:32	mawk	not updating when updates are available
2018-11-28 03:44:34	herbert_cyborg	security updates fall under "I need to"
2018-11-28 03:44:35	BCMM	i didn't mean automatic as in unattended, i meant as in, is there an update feature or just an install-again feature
2018-11-28 03:44:39	herbert_cyborg	Not every update is a security update
2018-11-28 03:44:40	mawk	ah
2018-11-28 03:44:43	Psi-Jack	herbert_cyborg: In other words, you violate the very foundation of Arch and do partial updates? Bad boy!
2018-11-28 03:44:49	herbert_cyborg	and in fact, if you install every update, you will be more likely to end up with a vulnerability
2018-11-28 03:45:10	herbert_cyborg	That's why distros like RHEL and Debian Stable like to stay so far behind and just selectively apply security patches
2018-11-28 03:45:20	mawk	why more likely ? any incremental update was the bleeding edge update at any point in time
2018-11-28 03:45:23	Psi-Jack	That's not actually true.
2018-11-28 03:45:30	mawk	so any update has the same probability has adding new vulns

2018-11-28 03:46:26	BCMM	mawk: so if you're using a version from N months ago, that's N months of bugs introduced by added features you don't have, but it still hopefully has all the fixes of the current version

2018-11-28 05:09:07	kerframil	by the way, is there a reason you're doing a raw image-based copy? is it a bootable drive or something?

2018-11-28 05:09:56	kerframil	why not just copy the files then? rather than the entire content of the block device?
2018-11-28 05:10:07	kerframil	the latter is the slowest way to make a backup
2018-11-28 05:10:12	happyhobo	because mawk said to dd not cp

2018-11-28 05:10:54	kerframil	well no. I think the issue here is not one about dd vs cp (they're actually interchangeable for this case). but why you're copying from /dev/sdb as a raw block device in the first place rather than just mounting it and cp -r or rsyncing the files to the destination directory.

2018-11-28 06:00:09	happyhobo	I still have two harddrives to transfer.
2018-11-28 06:00:10	pingfloyd	this is why security is difficult.  Weighing out convenience vs being secure.

2018-11-28 06:01:00	jaziz	would be better if we could just give every hacker the chair
2018-11-28 06:01:10	pingfloyd	like how hardened the security should be is determined by what you're trying to protect

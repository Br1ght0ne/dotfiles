2018-09-02 16:27:08	Zexaron	well there's no error so exit code is proably 0, but this isn't debugging so I don't need to be that specific
2018-09-02 16:27:28	Zexaron	strive: yeah in this case it's not sure if it's working, it suppose to output some messages but it doesn't

2018-09-02 16:27:59	Zexaron	strive: it may be the intended operation, it's a bit a specific context because I'm not sure whether it's working or not, so I need another figure of speech
2018-09-02 16:28:20	strive	Have you tried redirection?
2018-09-02 16:28:24	Zexaron	This is documenting an issue report, that's why I want this elegant and clear figure of speech, otherwise it wouldn't be that important
2018-09-02 16:28:34	wigums	 try adding -v. what command is it?
2018-09-02 16:28:39	talx	/dev/null 2>&1 for no errors ?
2018-09-02 16:28:49	Zexaron	it's git clean df --dry-run ...
2018-09-02 16:29:03	wigums	dropping back to prompt with no output usually means it worked or is working
2018-09-02 16:29:08	wigums	oh thats diff
2018-09-02 16:29:08	Zexaron	it's not linux, it's git, but it doesn't matter, it runs in bash and exits and you get back to bash

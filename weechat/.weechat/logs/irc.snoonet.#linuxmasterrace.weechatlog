2018-03-18 11:19:31	+botnet	I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as lennart, is in fact, lennart/lennart, or as I've recently taken to calling it, lennart plus lennart. lennart is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning lennart system made useful by the lennart corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by lennart.

2018-09-02 15:54:49	ml	nah, I mean the Qt-side rendering
2018-09-02 15:57:43	Rhylx	ok, can I make it faster ?
2018-09-02 15:57:47	ml	but thanks for asking. I just realized that I'm probably the one with the problems
2018-09-02 15:57:58	ml	tbh, I don't know. No idea how rendering works
2018-09-02 15:59:28	Rhylx	? Why are you the one with problems ?
2018-09-02 15:59:43	Rhylx	Your qutebrowser starts rather fast no ?
2018-09-02 16:00:04	ml	yea, but I have 2214 errors at the strace stats, you only 613
2018-09-02 16:00:25	ml	which are not really errors, but rather stat checks that fail because a file or directory doesn't exit
2018-09-02 16:00:27	ml	exist*
2018-09-02 16:01:15	ml	the main reason why it starts fast for me is probably my CPU (i7-6560U) and my M.2 SSD
2018-09-02 16:02:47	Rhylx	ok. I see ;). If it's that then I can do a lot of things ^^

2018-11-27 19:09:19	reet	the browser window always stays on top and is completely black
2018-11-27 19:09:38	reet	if i resize the window I see duck duck go in 80s disco style
2018-11-27 19:09:45	reet	is this a known problem?
2018-11-27 19:09:53	jgkamat	idk about the always on top thing but I've seen the black window if HW acceleration is disabled in the VM
2018-11-27 19:10:07	reet	let me check, it should be enabled
2018-11-27 19:10:17	jgkamat	also make sure guest additions are working

2018-11-27 19:52:17	The-Compiler	Alish: does it work with --temp-basedir?
2018-11-27 19:53:10	The-Compiler	I'm guessing it's whatever non-default user agent you use
2018-11-27 19:53:25	Alish	lemme check it

2018-11-27 19:53:35	aydio	as of recently, my tabs have gotten higher, does anyone know why that is? https://ptpb.pw/ekzX
2018-11-27 19:54:37	The-Compiler	aydio: huh, odd - do they look the same with --temp-basedir?
2018-11-27 19:54:45	Alish	yeah its okay with --temp-basedir. which user agent I should use?
2018-11-27 19:55:07	The-Compiler	Alish: the default
2018-11-27 19:55:46	Alish	default is empty now
2018-11-27 19:56:12	The-Compiler	yeah, which uses whatever QtWebEngine has built-in
2018-11-27 19:56:42	aydio	The-Compiler: yeah, it's the same. Interestingly this seems to have happened when I changed the default font to Iosevka. However, when switching back to the default value, it turns back to normal. Also, when switching back to Iosevka, it stays normal as well.
2018-11-27 19:56:54	The-Compiler	aydio: huh, weird
2018-11-27 19:58:22	aydio	ok I think I found out why - this only happens when hooked up to my second monitor. Even though I disabled scaling in sway, it seems to do some HiDPI stuff on my laptop monitor (where the tab height fits perfectly)
2018-11-27 19:58:26	aydio	really weird

2018-11-27 19:46:33	Voidablazer	Yesterday I updated gentoo sources, depcleaned the old sources, and eselect kernel set the new sources but I didn't build the kernel or installed it. I shutdown my pc. Today should I first build and install my kernel (I have to emerge @modules_rebuild for VirtualBox also) and then emerge sync and update world? Or is it better to sync and update world first?

2018-11-27 19:56:34	+iamben	but just having a few qt5 bits for skype, doesn't mean you must or shoudl enable qt5 support everywhere else.  which i think is what his original question was about.

2018-11-27 21:15:10	Voidablazer	make modules_prepare is unnecessary if you are building the kernel anyway. It is strictly for when you are wanting to build modules without building the rest of the kernel. --Grknight (talk) 14:30, 8 November 2018 (UTC)
2018-11-27 21:15:21	+iamben	our wiki article should not mention modules_prepare at all, imho
2018-11-27 21:15:34	Keij0	so no clue about that teamviewer stuff?
2018-11-27 21:15:41	+iamben	it's ONLY used in scenarios where you cannot or will not do a full kernel build

2018-11-27 22:55:40	coot__	Hello, I need some help installing Gentoo on a ThinkPad P1.  I went through the installation handbook, and I successfully installed the stage3 tarball.  The problem arise when I try to boot.  It's an uefi installation with a grub2 installed on the uefi partition. After grub tries to load a linux kernel with `linux /vmlinuz-4.18.18-gentoo-r1 root=/dev/mapper/fedora-00`  there is no single message.  Any ideas how to debug this?

2018-11-28 04:27:21	tdoirc	while on the topic, and also because i'm not getting a reply in netfilter, trying to get forwarding across my server to the netns, I have routes set up for the networks such that I can ping from inside the netns to out, and vice versa (server local that is), but I can't get forwarding from one network to the other working. I'm trying to do it without NAT, I have -A FORWARD -i bond0.1 -o veth0_0 -j ACCEPT and vice versa, but
2018-11-28 04:27:21	tdoirc	I can't reach it from my network (server is default route and has ip_forward on)
